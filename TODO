Implement soft delete on all resources.

Users can {create}, {update} or delete their accounts.

Users can {create}, {edit} and delete their own post-it.

Users can reply to a post-it, but a post-it’s reply can not have another reply. So replies are not recursive. ✅

A post-it’s author cannot delete replies to their own post-its unless it is their own reply; if they delete their post-it the replies remain.

A deleted comment should not be returned in a response.

Users can delete their own post-its’ replies. [ User-A can delete his/her own reply and cannot delete User-B replies]

When returning post-its they should be sorted by newest first. That is, newly created post-its should come first and the old ones last. ✅

Decide what you will do with deleted post-its, and in your readme, explain what you later did.
